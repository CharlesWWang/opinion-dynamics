def deGroot(A, s, max_rounds, eps=1e-6, plot=False, conv_stop=True):
    '''Simulates the DeGroot Model.

    Runs a maximum of max_rounds rounds of the DeGroot model. If the model
    converges sooner, the function returns. Chosing not to plot the opinions
    allows for lower memory consumption and faster runtime.

    Args:

        A (NxN numpy array): Adjacency matrix

        s (1xN numpy array): Initial opinions vector

        max_rounds (int): Maximum number of rounds to simulate

        eps (double): Maximum difference between rounds before we assume that
        the model has converged (default: 1e-6)

        plot (bool): Plot preference (default: False)

        conv_stop (bool): Stop the simulation if the model has converged
        (default: True)

    Returns:

        A txN vector of the opinions of the nodes over time
